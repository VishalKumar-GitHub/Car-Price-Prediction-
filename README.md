# Car-Price-Prediction-
##How do you evaluate the apt Price for a second hand cars?

##You look at the number of years, the type of fuel, how many KMS it has run etc.

In this case study, the task is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a second-hand car based on these specifications.

##Case Study Flow:
Reading the Data in Python: Begin by loading the dataset into Python using pandas or another suitable library.

Defining the Problem Statement: The primary objective is to predict the price of second-hand cars based on their specifications, such as the number of years, fuel type, kilometers driven, etc.

Identifying the Target Variable: The Price column will be identified as the target variable, as it is the variable we want to predict.

Exploring the Distribution of the Target Variable: Examine the distribution of the target variable (Price) to understand its range and any potential skewness.

Basic Data Exploration: Perform initial analysis to check for any obvious issues or patterns in the dataset.

Rejecting Useless Columns: Remove any columns that do not provide useful information for predicting car prices.

Visual Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use Histograms and Bar charts to visualize the distribution of numerical and categorical data, helping to identify trends and patterns.

Feature Selection Based on Data Distribution: Select relevant features based on their distribution and correlation with the target variable.

Outlier Treatment: Detect and treat any outliers in the data, which might skew the results.

Missing Values Treatment: Handle any missing data by either imputing values or removing rows/columns with significant missing values.

Visual Correlation Analysis: Use visual methods like heatmaps to analyze the correlation between different features and the target variable.

Statistical Correlation Analysis (Feature Selection): Perform statistical tests to evaluate the strength of the relationship between each feature and the target variable, helping to select the most important predictors.

Converting Data to Numeric for Machine Learning: Convert categorical features into numeric values using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding to make the data suitable for machine learning models.

Sampling and K-Fold Cross Validation: Split the data into training and testing sets, and use K-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance.

Trying Multiple Regression Algorithms: Experiment with different regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost, and others to predict car prices.

Selecting the Best Model: Evaluate the performance of all models and select the one with the best accuracy and lowest error rates.

Data Details:
Dataset: The dataset is stored in the file "CarPricesData.csv", containing 1435 car price records.
