# Car Price Prediction

## Objective
The goal of this project is to **predict the price of second-hand cars** based on their specifications such as:
- **Number of years (Age of the car)**
- **Fuel type**
- **Kilometers driven** 
- And other relevant features

In this case study, the task is to build a machine learning model that can **accurately predict the price** of a second-hand car based on these specifications.

## Case Study Flow

1. **Reading the Data in Python**  
   Begin by loading the dataset into Python using pandas or another suitable library.

2. **Defining the Problem Statement**  
   The primary objective is to predict the price of second-hand cars based on their specifications like the number of years, fuel type, kilometers driven, etc.

3. **Identifying the Target Variable**  
   The **Price** column will be identified as the target variable, as it is the variable we want to predict.

4. **Exploring the Distribution of the Target Variable**  
   Examine the distribution of the target variable (**Price**) to understand its range and any potential skewness.

5. **Basic Data Exploration**  
   Perform initial analysis to check for any obvious issues or patterns in the dataset.

6. **Rejecting Useless Columns**  
   Remove any columns that do not provide useful information for predicting car prices.

7. **Visual Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Use **Histograms** and **Bar charts** to visualize the distribution of numerical and categorical data, helping to identify trends and patterns.

8. **Feature Selection Based on Data Distribution**  
   Select relevant features based on their distribution and correlation with the target variable.

9. **Outlier Treatment**  
   Detect and treat any outliers in the data, which might skew the results.

10. **Missing Values Treatment**  
    Handle any missing data by either imputing values or removing rows/columns with significant missing values.

11. **Visual Correlation Analysis**  
    Use visual methods like **heatmaps** to analyze the correlation between different features and the target variable.

12. **Statistical Correlation Analysis (Feature Selection)**  
    Perform statistical tests to evaluate the strength of the relationship between each feature and the target variable, helping to select the most important predictors.

13. **Converting Data to Numeric for Machine Learning**  
    Convert categorical features into numeric values using techniques like **one-hot encoding** or **label encoding** to make the data suitable for machine learning models.

14. **Sampling and K-Fold Cross Validation**  
    Split the data into training and testing sets, and use **K-fold cross-validation** to evaluate model performance.

15. **Trying Multiple Regression Algorithms**  
    Experiment with different regression algorithms such as **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest Regressor**, **XGBoost**, and others to predict car prices.

16. **Selecting the Best Model**  
    Evaluate the performance of all models and select the one with the best accuracy and lowest error rates.
